# .zshrc Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### ‚ùå **Error**: `/Users/mattroman/.oh-my-zsh/oh-my-zsh.sh` not found
- **Cause**: Oh My Zsh was not installed but .zshrc was trying to load it
- **Fix**: Removed Oh My Zsh references, kept only Powerlevel10k theme loading
- **Result**: Using Powerlevel10k directly via Homebrew installation

### ‚ùå **Error**: `Can't find Ruby library file colorls`
- **Cause**: colorls gem was not installed but .zshrc was trying to use it
- **Fix**: Removed colorls references and aliases
- **Result**: Standard `ls` command works normally

### ‚ùå **Error**: `no such file or directory: /tab_complete.sh`
- **Cause**: Broken path reference from colorls that wasn't installed
- **Fix**: Removed the broken colorls tab completion source
- **Result**: No more broken file reference

### ‚ùå **Error**: `No such plugin: java`
- **Cause**: ASDF java plugin not installed but configuration assumed it was
- **Fix**: Added conditional check `if asdf where java &>/dev/null; then`
- **Result**: Java paths only set if java is actually installed via ASDF

### ‚ùå **Error**: `/opt/homebrew/opt/asdf/asdf.sh` not found
- **Cause**: Wrong path to ASDF initialization script
- **Fix**: Changed to correct path: `$(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh`
- **Result**: ASDF loads properly

### üîí **Security**: Hardcoded Semgrep token removed
- **Cause**: API token was hardcoded in .zshrc (security risk)
- **Fix**: Removed hardcoded token, added commented instructions for setting as environment variable
- **Result**: No more exposed API token

## Additional Improvements:

### ‚úÖ **Conditional Loading**
- Bun paths only added if Bun is installed
- Docker completions only loaded if Docker Desktop is installed
- Java configuration only applied if ASDF java plugin exists

### ‚úÖ **Correct ASDF Loading**
- Fixed ASDF initialization path
- Maintained proper PATH configuration for ASDF shims
- Kept Erlang/Elixir build configuration

### ‚úÖ **Cleaner Configuration**
- Removed duplicate/conflicting configurations
- Added explanatory comments
- Maintained working Powerlevel10k theme setup

## Current Working Configuration:

- ‚úÖ Powerlevel10k theme loaded directly from Homebrew
- ‚úÖ ASDF version manager working correctly
- ‚úÖ Ruby and Node.js available via ASDF
- ‚úÖ Erlang/Elixir build configuration preserved
- ‚úÖ Conditional loading for optional tools
- ‚úÖ No more error messages on shell startup

## Usage:

Your shell should now load cleanly without errors. If you want to add back any of the removed tools:

- **Oh My Zsh**: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
- **colorls**: `gem install colorls` (requires Ruby)
- **Java via ASDF**: `asdf plugin add java && asdf install java latest`
